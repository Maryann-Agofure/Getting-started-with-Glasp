# An Introduction to Glasp: The Social Web Highlighter for you
For writers, web researchers, and everyone using the internet today, switching back and forth between web pages can be tiresome, especially when only bits and pieces of information is needed from these individual sites. However, thanks to Glasp, highlighting and organizing bits of information becomes easier. Glasp is fondly referred to as the social media web highlighter, because it not only allows users highlight, organize and quote useful ideas from web pages, but also lets users access quotes from similar-minded individuals which may improve their own understanding.
## What is Glasp
Glasp aims to improve individual collective knowledge by removing the privacy induced by most notes-taking applications. By highlighting and sharing content grabbed from sites, individuals can find and build a community with like-minded individuals, while simultaneously improving on their knowledge of a subject.
## Features of Glasp
Glasp thrives based on these three core features:
- Highlight: Glasp allows users to capture online content by using any of its colored highlighting options. Users scrolling through web content can simply grab important texts or quotes for further perusal instead of revisiting the same page several times over.
- Save and share: Glasp users can save these highlighted content and share them on their Glasp homepage, making them accessible by other Glasp users with similar highlights.
- Discover and connect with similar-minded individuals and content: Glasp promotes community-building via its highlighted content sharing. Individuals with similar highlighted content can discover themselves, grow their understanding of a particular subject area, and build new connections.
