## Introduction

Most web users switch between web pages, finding bits and pieces of information and taking notes. However, the repetitive back-and-forth action involved can be inefficient. [Glasp](https://glasp.co/about) helps make this process proceed more smoothly and improves efficiency. It does this by enabling users to highlight, organize and save portions of text for later use. In addition, it lets users access quotes from similar-minded individuals, which may improve their understanding.  
This article provides a quick starting guide for Glasp and shows you how to create an account, create and share your first highlight, and connect with other members of the Glasp community.

## What is Glasp?

Glasp aims to improve individual and collective knowledge by removing the privacy induced by most note-taking applications. By highlighting and sharing content from web pages, individuals not only improve their workflow productivity but also find and build a community with like-minded individuals while improving their knowledge of a subject.

## Features of Glasp

Glasp aims to fulfill its objectives through these three core features:

- **Highlight**: Glasp lets users capture online content through its numerous colored highlighting options. Users scrolling through web content can grab important texts or quotes for further perusal instead of revisiting the same page several times.
- **Save and share**: Glasp users can save and share these highlighted content on their homepage, making them accessible to other users with similar topics.
- **Discover and connect with similar-minded individuals and content**: Glasp promotes community-building via its highlighted content sharing. Individuals with similar highlighted content can discover themselves, grow their understanding of a particular subject area, and build new connections.
